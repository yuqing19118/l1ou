\title{Normalizes branch lengths to a unit tree height}
\usage{
normalize_tree(tree, check.ultrametric = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{ultrametric tree of class phylo with branch lengths, and edges in postorder.}

\item{check.ultrametric}{logical. If TRUE, it checks if the input tree is ultrametric.}
}
\value{
normalized phylogenetic tree, of class phylo.
}
\description{
Normalizes all branch lengths including the root.edge if presents by the same factor, so that the distance from the root to all tips is equal to one.
