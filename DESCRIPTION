Title: Tools for detecting past changes in the expected mean trait values and
    studying trait evolution from comparative data
Author: Mohammad Khabbazian [aut], Cecile Ane [ctb], Qing Yu (Sabrina) [ctb]

Description: Provides functions to study trait evolution from comparative data
    and detect past changes in the expected mean trait values. It uses the Ornstein-
    Uhlenbeck process, which can model a changing adaptive landscape over time and
    over lineages. Detection of evolutionary shifts in trait evolution from extant
    taxa is motivated by the study of convergent evolution, or to correlate shifts
    in traits with habitat changes or with changes in other phenotypes.
